      <h2>Not a problem.</h2>
      <p>The coverage you have may still be helpful. Let’s check. I entered some example amounts here for you, but you should adjust them.</p>

        </label>
        <p class="help-text" id="deductible-help-text-outofnetwork">You can enter your yearly deducible, or if you want to get specific, enter the amount you typically have left after your existing medical expenses. (It might be zero!)</p>
        <label><span>Your co-insurance rate:</span>
          <input type="text" id="coinsurance-field" value="30" aria-describedby="coinsurance-help-text" required pattern="number">
          <span class="form-error">
            Enter a number.
          </span>
        </label>
        <p class="help-text" id="coinsurance-help-text">Your co-insurance rate is the percentage that you have to pay for each session after you’ve met your deductibe. For example, your insurance may cover 70% of each session, so your co-insurance would be 30%.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>There are also a few "advanced options" that are a little more rare:</p>
        <label><span>Your co-payment for out-of-network providers:</span>
          <input type="text" id="outofnetwork-copay-amount-field" value="" aria-describedby="outofnetwork-copay-help-text" pattern="number">

          </span>
        </label>
        <p class="help-text" id="outofnetwork-copay-help-text">You probably don’t have this if you also have co-insurance, but some plans have both. :( Leave this blank if yours doesn’t.</p>

        <label><span>Your plan’s approved amount for each therapy session:</span>

          <span class="form-error">

          </span>
        </label>
        <p class="help-text" id="approved-amount-help-text">This is annoying, but your insurance can put a limit on what they think an hour of therapy <em>should</em> cost. For example, your therapist may charge you $100 an hour, but your insurance may decide this service is only worth $80. If you know you have an approved amount limit, enter it here. Otherwise we’ll assume you don’t.</p>

      <p>There’s another thing to check: <strong>tax deductions</strong>.</p>
      <p>I know, thinking about taxes right now is kinda terrible. But deductions might make a big difference.

              <h3>Is this calculator correct?</h3>
              <p>As I mentioned in the disclaimer, I’m not an expert! I am, however, currently paying for my own therapist with a mix of out-of-network insurance claims and a Flexible Spending Account. I wanted to show people how the sticker price for therapy isn’t necessarily what you’re stuck paying... and then I kept researching insurance and tax deduction combinations... and many hours later, this calculator was born.</p>
              <p>Please think of this is an exploration of your options, and talk to your insurance and tax professionals for verified expert advice.</p>

              <h3>Should I go to therapy?</h3>
              <p>That’s a big question, and it’s completely up to you and your doctors! They’ll give you better advice than I can. But clearly I'm a fan, and I want to destigmatize getting help if you decide you want it.</p>
